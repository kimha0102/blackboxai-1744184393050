# AgriFinTech Solutions

## Project Overview
AgriFinTech Solutions is a web application aimed at empowering smallholder farmers by providing them with AI-powered market intelligence, price predictions, and financial services. The application offers real-time market data, forecasts, and access to essential financial services to help farmers make informed decisions on when and where to sell their produce.

## Installation
To run this project locally, you need to have Python, Flask, and Node.js installed on your machine. Follow the steps below to set up the project:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Set up the Python server**:
   - Navigate to the directory containing `app.py`.
   - Create a virtual environment (optional, but recommended):
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
     ```
   - Install the required Python packages:
     ```bash
     pip install flask pandas scikit-learn joblib
     ```

3. **Run the Flask server**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. **Open the `index.html` file** in your browser or set up a simple HTTP server to serve it.

## Usage
Once the server is running, access the application by navigating to `http://localhost:8000/api/market-data` or simply open the `index.html` page in your browser. From the interface, you can:
- Fetch real-time market data for crops.
- Get price predictions by entering the crop name (maize, wheat, or rice).
- View available financial services tailored for farmers.

## Features
- **Market Intelligence**: Provides real-time crop prices, demand trends, and market analysis powered by AI.
- **Price Predictions**: AI-driven forecasts to help farmers determine the best times to market their produce.
- **Financial Services**: Access to microloans, crop insurance, and digital payments specifically designed for farmers.

## Dependencies
The project utilizes the following key dependencies:

- **Python Packages**:
  - `Flask`: For creating the web server.
  - `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - `scikit-learn`: For implementing machine learning models.
  - `joblib`: For saving and loading Python objects.

- **Frontend**:
  - **Tailwind CSS**: For responsive design and layout.
  - **Font Awesome**: For icons.
